The Time-Honored Tradition in Computer Programming

Coding was never really an options for me as I embarked into adulthood and choices of professions. I recently entered a particularly challenging time in my life, I was re-evaluating my passions, interests, skills, honestly wondering what on this earth makes me come alive. A friend came along side me and introduced me to the idea of taking a shot at coding/computer programming. At first, I was hesitant because I had never seen myself as being capable of the feets being described, and I had no idea if this would be something that I would enjoy, that would leave me fulfilled, and that would make me come alive. My friend believed in me though (and still does during this whole process) and ever since I learned my first HTML element, I've been hooked. I am finding myself really enjoying creating new things, and learning how some simple but strategic placements of words, numbers, and symbols can instruct a whole machine to do my will! I will forever be grateful for the discovery of coding/computer programming and the loving proding of my friend!
